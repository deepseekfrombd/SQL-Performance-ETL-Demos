## 🔍 11️⃣ SQL Server Performance Tuning Essentials

Performance tuning in SQL Server involves analyzing query performance, indexing, statistics, and resource usage. Below are **actionable techniques**, code snippets, and official resources to optimize queries and improve performance.

---

### 📏 Analyze Query Performance

Enable real-time metrics:

```sql
SET STATISTICS IO ON;
SET STATISTICS TIME ON;

-- Sample Query
SELECT * FROM Loan WHERE TransDate = '2023-07-16';
```

---

### 🧠 Use DMVs to Find Problem Queries

Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) offer insights into resource-intensive queries.

#### 🔍 Top 5 slowest queries (by average time):

```sql
SELECT TOP 5 
    qs.total_elapsed_time / qs.execution_count AS AvgElapsedTime,
    qt.text AS QueryText
FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats qs
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) qt
ORDER BY AvgElapsedTime DESC;
```

---

### 📌 Indexing Strategy

Proper indexing can significantly reduce IO and improve performance.

#### Create a nonclustered index:

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_TransDate
ON Loan(TransDate)
INCLUDE (LoanID, Amount);
```

✅ Use `INCLUDE` for covering indexes on read-heavy queries.

---

### ❌ Avoid `SELECT *`

Fetching all columns increases IO unnecessarily.

```sql
-- Bad
SELECT * FROM Loan WHERE TransDate = '2023-01-01';

-- Good
SELECT LoanID, Amount FROM Loan WHERE TransDate = '2023-01-01';
```

---

### ✅ Use SARGable Conditions

Non-SARGable (non-searchable) conditions hurt performance:

```sql
-- ❌ Avoid this (non-SARGable)
WHERE YEAR(TransDate) = 2023;

-- ✅ Use this (SARGable)
WHERE TransDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```

---

### 📊 Keep Statistics Updated

Outdated statistics mislead the query optimizer.

```sql
UPDATE STATISTICS Loan;
```

---

### 🔁 Rebuild or Reorganize Indexes

```sql
-- Rebuild (more effective, uses more resources)
ALTER INDEX ALL ON Loan REBUILD;

-- Or Reorganize (lighter option)
ALTER INDEX ALL ON Loan REORGANIZE;
```

---

### 🚦 Use `WITH (NOLOCK)` for Reporting

```sql
SELECT LoanID, Amount
FROM Loan WITH (NOLOCK)
WHERE TransDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```

⚠️ **Warning**: May return dirty reads. Use only for read-only reports.
