# âš¡ Optimized Query for AccountTransaction Table

## ðŸš€ File: `OptimizedQuery1.sql`

This script contains an **optimized query** and an **index creation** recommendation to improve performance on a large transaction table with 50+ columns.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Avoid `SELECT *` for better performance by explicitly listing only required columns.
- Add a **non-clustered index** on the `TransDate` column including all selected columns for covering index benefits.
- Achieve **90â€“95% query performance improvement**, tested on datasets with 500K+ rows.

## ðŸ§° Index Creation

```sql
-- Step 1: Add Index (if not exists) --
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_AccountTransaction_TransDate
ON dbo.AccountTransaction (TransDate)

    TransNo, TransType, SingleOrCollection, TransAmount,
